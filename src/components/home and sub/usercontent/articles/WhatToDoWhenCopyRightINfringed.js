                        Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), OpenSea maintains a notice and takedown process for alleged copyright infringement. In accordance with this U.S. federal law, OpenSea allows users to report content if they believe that it violates their copyright. To request that a collection or item be taken down because you believe that it violates your copyright, please reach out to our Support team.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">How does OpenSea process copyright takedown requests? </h2>
                    <br />

                    <p className="text-[16px]">
                        Upon receiving a copyright takedown request, we evaluate the submission for completeness and authenticity. If we determine that a takedown request fulfills the requirements of the DMCA, we will delist the allegedly infringing content from our site. OpenSea does not make subjective determinations as to the legal merit of copyright claims.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p className="text-[16px]">

                        When OpenSea delists a collection or item due to copyright infringement, we take steps to inform the affected users. If we have an email on file for the creator of the delisted content, we will forward them a copy of the takedown request with any personally identifying information (PII) redacted and will also provide instructions for filing a counter-notice. If we have an email on file for the owner of the delisted content, and they have opted to receive emails from OpenSea, we will email that user letting them know that item has been delisted.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p className="text-[16px]">
                        As permitted under the DMCA, the affected user may submit a counter-notice in which they affirm their good faith belief that the content was delisted as a result of a mistake or misidentification. For more information on counter-notices, please visit our Help Center article.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">What happens if the affected user files a counter-notice?</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p className="text-[16px]">
                        If the affected user files a counter-notice, we will forward a copy to the complainant. After receiving a counter-notice, the complainant may choose to file a legal action seeking a court order to prevent the affected user from engaging in infringing activity. If they do not file a court action and forward us proof of their filing within 10 business days of receiving the counter-notice, pursuant to the DMCA, the content will be relisted on OpenSea.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p className="text-[16px]">
                        In other words, if we receive a counter-notice, the original complainant will need to file a court action if they wish to prevent the allegedly infringing content from being reinstated on OpenSea. Additionally, under the DMCA, any person who knowingly misrepresents material as infringing will be liable for damages incurred by the alleged infringer due to their content being delisted. We strongly encourage users to keep these facts in mind when determining whether to submit a takedown request.

                    <p className="text-[16px]">
                        A copyright is an exclusive legal right given to the creator over the ability to distribute a creative work. If you are unsure whether you own the rights to work on OpenSea, we recommend that you consult an attorney as we are unable to provide legal advice.
